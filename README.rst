Summary
-------

Decorators are great, but they're hard to write, especially if you want
to include arguments to your decorators, or use your decorators on
class methods as well as functions. I know that, no matter how many I write,
I still find myself looking up the syntax every time. And that's just for
simple function decorators. Getting decorators to work consistently at the
class and method level is a whole 'nother barrel of worms.

PyDecor aims to make function decoration easy and straightforward, so that
developers can stop worrying about closures and syntax in triply nested
functions and instead get down to decorating!


.. contents:: Table of Contents


Quickstart
----------

Install ``pydecor``::

  pip install pydecor

Use one of the ready-to-wear decorators:

.. code:: python

    # Memoize a function

    from pydecor import memoize


    @memoize()
    def fibonacci(n):
        """Compute the given number of the fibonacci sequence"""
        if n < 2:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1)

    print(fibonacci(150))


.. code:: python

    # Intercept an error and raise a different one

    from flask import Flask
    from pydecor import intercept
    from werkzeug.exceptions import InternalServerError


    app = Flask(__name__)


    @app.route('/')
    @intercept(catch=Exception, reraise=InternalServerError,
               err_msg='The server encountered an error rendering "some_view"')
    def some_view():
        """The root view"""
        assert False
        return 'Asserted False successfully!'


    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get('/')

    assert response.status_code == 500
    assert 'some_view'.encode() in resp.data


Use a generic decorator to run your own functions ``@before``, ``@after``,
or ``@instead`` of another function, like in the following example,
which sets a User-Agent header on a Flask response:

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask, make_response
    from pydecor import Decorated, after


    app = Flask(__name__)

   # `Decorated` instances are passed to your functions and contain
   # information about the wrapped function, including its `args`,
   # `kwargs`, and `result`, if it's been called.

    def set_user_agent(decorated: Decorated):
        """Sets the user-agent header on a result from a view"""
        resp = make_response(decorated.result)
        resp.headers.set('User-Agent', 'my_applicatoin')
        return resp


    @app.route('/')
    @after(set_user_agent)
    def index_view():
        return 'Hello, world!'


    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get('/')
    assert response.headers.get('User-Agent') == 'my_application'


Or make your own decorator with ``construct_decorator``

.. code:: python

    from flask import request
    from pydecor import Decorated, construct_decorator
    from werkzeug.exceptions import Unauthorized


    def check_auth(_decorated: Decorated, request):
        """Theoretically checks auth.

        It goes without saying, but this is example code. You should
        not actually check auth this way!
        """
        if request.host != 'localhost':
            raise Unauthorized('locals only!')


    authed = construct_decorator(before=check_auth)


    app = Flask(__name__)


    @app.route('/')
    # Any keyword arguments provided to any of the generic decorators are
    # passed directly to your callable.
    @authed(request=request)
    def some_view():
        """An authenticated view"""
        return 'This is sensitive data!'


Why PyDecor?
------------

* **It's easy!**

  With PyDecor, you can go from this:

  .. code:: python

    from functools import wraps
    from flask import request
    from werkzeug.exceptions import Unauthorized
    from my_pkg.auth import authorize_request

    def auth_decorator(request=None):
        """Check the passed request for authentication"""

        def decorator(decorated):

            @wraps(decorated)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                if not authorize_request(request):
                  raise Unauthorized('Not authorized!')
                return decorated(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper

        return decorator

    @auth_decorator(request=requst)
    def some_view():
        return 'Hello, World!'

  to this:

  .. code:: python

    from flask import request
    from pydecor import before
    from werkzeug.exceptions import Unauthorized
    from my_pkg.auth import authorize_request

    def check_auth(_decorated, request=request):
        """Ensure the request is authorized"""
        if not authorize_request(request):
          raise Unauthorized('Not authorized!')

    @before(check_auth, request=request)
    def some_view():
        return 'Hello, world!'

  Not only is it less code, but you don't have to remember decorator
  syntax or mess with nested functions. Full disclosure, I had to look
  up a decorator sample to be sure I got the first example's syntax right,
  and I just spent two weeks writing a decorator library.

* **It's fast!**

  PyDecor aims to make your life easier, not slower. The decoration machinery
  is designed to be as efficient as is reasonable, and contributions to
  speed things up are always welcome.

* **Implicit Method Decoration!**

  Getting a decorator to "roll down" to methods when applied to a class is
  a complicated business, but all of PyDecor's decorators provide it for
  free, so rather than writing:

  .. code:: python

    from pydecor import log_call

    class FullyLoggedClass(object):

        @log_call(level='debug')
        def some_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return args, kwargs

        @log_call(level='debug')
        def another_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return None

        ...

  You can just write:

  .. code:: python

    from pydecor import log_call

    @log_call(level='debug')
    class FullyLoggedClass(object):

        def some_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return args, kwargs

        def another_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return None

        ...

  PyDecor ignores special methods (like ``__init__``) so as not to interfere
  with deep Python magic. By default, it works on any methods of a class,
  including instance, class and static methods. It also ensures that class
  attributes are preserved after decoration, so your class references
  continue to behave as expected.

* **Consistent Method Decoration!**

  Whether you're decorating a class, an instance method, a class method, or
  a static method, you can use the same passed function. ``self`` and ``cls``
  variables are stripped out of the method parameters passed to the provided
  callable, so your functions don't need to care about where they're used.

* **Lots of Tests!**

  Seriously. Don't believe me? Just look. We've got the best tests. Just
  phenomenal.


Installation
------------

**`pydecor` 2.0 and forward supports only Python 3.6+!**

If you need support for an older Python, use the most recent 1.x release.

To install `pydecor`, simply run::

  pip install -U pydecor

To install the current development release::

  pip install --pre -U pydecor

You can also install from source to get the absolute most recent
code, which may or may not be functional::

  git clone https://github.com/mplanchard/pydecor
  pip install ./pydecor

Provided Decorators
*******************

This package provides generic decorators, which can be used with any
function to provide extra utility to decorated resources, as well
as prête-à-porter (ready-to-wear) decorators for immediate use.

While the information below is enough to get you started, I highly
recommend checking out the `decorator module docs`_ to see all the
options and details for the various decorators!

Generics
~~~~~~~~

* ``@before`` - run a callable before the decorated function executes

  * called with an instance of `Decorated` and any provided kwargs

* ``@after`` - run a callable after the decorated function executes

  * called with an instance of `Decorated` and any provided kwargs

* ``@instead`` - run a callable in place of the decorated function

  * called with an instance of `Decorated` and any provided kwargs

* ``@decorate`` - specify multiple callables to be run before, after, and/or
  instead of the decorated function

  * callables passed to ``decorate``'s ``before``, ``after``, or ``instead``
    keyword arguments will be called with the same default function signature
    as described for the individual decorators, above. Extras will be
    passed to all provided callables.

* ``construct_decorator`` - specify functions to be run ``before``, ``after``,
  or ``instead`` of decorated functions. Returns a reusable decorator.

The callable passed to a generic decorator is expected to handle at least one
positional argument, which will be an instance of `Decorated`. `Decorated`
objects provide the following interface:

**Attributes:**

* `args`: a tuple of any positional arguments with which the decorated
  callable was called
* `kwargs`: a dict of any keyword arguments with which the decorated
  callable was called
* `wrapped`: a reference to the decorated callable
* `result`: when the _wrapped_ function has been called, its return value is
  stored here

**Methods**

* `__call__(*args, **kwargs)`: a shortcut to
  `decorated.wrapped(*args, **kwargs)`, calling an instance of `Decorated`
  calls the underlying wrapped callable. The result of this call (or a
  direct call to `decorated.wrapped()`) will set the `result` attribute.

Every generic decorator may take any number of keyword arguments, which will be
passed directly into the provided callable, so, running the code below prints
"red":

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import before

    def before_func(_decorated, label=None):
        print(label)

    @before(before_func, label='red')
    def red_function():
        pass

    red_function()

Every generic decorator takes the following keyword arguments:

* ``implicit_method_decoration`` - if True, decorating a class implies
  decorating all of its methods. **Caution:** you should probably leave this
  on unless you know what you are doing.
* ``instance_methods_only`` - if True, only instance methods (not class or
  static methods) will be automatically decorated when
  ``implicit_method_decoration`` is True

The ``construct_decorator`` function can be used to combine ``@before``,
``@after``, and ``@instead`` calls into one decorator, without having to
worry about unintended stacking effects. Let's make a
decorator that announces when we're starting an exiting a function:

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import construct_decorator

    def before_func(decorated):
        print('Starting decorated function '
              '"{}"'.format(decorated.wrapped.__name__))

    def after_func(decorated):
        print('"{}" gave result "{}"'.format(
            decorated.wrapped.__name__, decorated.result
        ))

    my_decorator = construct_decorator(before=before_func, after=after_func)

    @my_decorator()
    def this_function_returns_nothing():
        return 'nothing'

And the output?

.. code::

    Starting decorated function "this_function_returns_nothing"
    "this_function_returns_nothing" gave result "nothing"


Maybe a more realistic example would be useful. Let's say we want to add
headers to a Flask response.

.. code:: python


    from flask import Flask, Response, make_response
    from pydecor import construct_decorator


    def _set_app_json_header(decorated):
        # Ensure the response is a Response object, even if a tuple was
        # returned by the view function.
        response = make_response(decorated.result)
        response.headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
        return response


    application_json = construct_decorator(after=_set_app_json_header)


    # Now you can decorate any Flask view, and your headers will be set.

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Note that you must decorate "before" (closer to) the function than the
    # app.route() decoration, because the route decorator must be called on
    # the "finalized" version of your function

    @app.route('/')
    @application_json()
    def root_view():
        return 'Hello, world!'

    client = app.test_client()
    response = app.get('/')

    print(response.headers)


The output?

..code::

    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 13


Prête-à-porter (ready-to-wear)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``export`` - add the decorated class or function to its module's `__all__`
  list, exposing it as a "public" reference.
* ``intercept`` - catch the specified exception and optionally re-raise and/or
  call a provided callback to handle the exception
* ``log_call`` - automatically log the decorated function's call signature and
  results
* ``memoize`` - memoize a function's call and return values for re-use. Can
  use any cache in ``pydecor.caches``, which all have options for automatic
  pruning to keep the memoization cache from growing too large.

Caches
******

Three caches are provided with ``pydecor``. These are designed to be passed
to the ``@memoization`` decorator if you want to use something other than
the default ``LRUCache``, but they are perfectly functional for use elsewhere.

All caches implement the standard dictionary interface.


LRUCache
~~~~~~~~

A least-recently-used cache. Both getting and setting of key/value pairs
results in their having been considered most-recently-used. When the cache
reaches the specified ``max_size``, least-recently-used items are discarded.

FIFOCache
~~~~~~~~~

A first-in, first-out cache. When the cache reaches the specified ``max_size``,
the first item that was inserted is discarded, then the second, and so on.

TimedCache
~~~~~~~~~~

A cache whose entries expire. If a ``max_age`` is specified, any entries older
than the ``max_age`` (in seconds) will be considered invalid, and will be
removed upon access.


Stacking
********

Generic and ready-to-wear decorators may be stacked! You can stack multiple
of the same decorator, or you can mix and match. Some gotchas are listed
below.

Generally, stacking works just as you might expect, but some care must be
taken when using the ``@instead`` decorator, or ``@intercept``, which
uses ``@instead`` under the hood.

Just remember that ``@instead`` replaces everything that comes before. So,
as long as ``@instead`` calls the decorated function, it's okay to stack it.
In these cases, it will be called *before* any decorators specified below
it, and those decorators will be executed when it calls the decorated function.
``@intercept`` behaves this way, too.

If an ``@instead`` decorator does *not* call the decorated function and
instead replaces it entirely, it **must** be specified first (at the bottom
of the stacked decorator pile), otherwise the decorators below it will not
execute.

For ``@before`` and ``@after``, it doesn't matter in what order the decorators
are specified. ``@before`` is always called first, and ``@after`` last.


Class Decoration
****************

Class decoration is difficult, but PyDecor aims to make it as easy and
intuitive as possible!

By default, decorating a class applies that decorator to all of that class'
methods (instance, class, and static). The decoration applies to class and
static methods whether they are referenced via an instance or via a class
reference. "Extras" specified at the class level persist across calls to
different methods, allowing for things like a class level memoization
dictionary (there's a very basic test in the test suite
that demonstrates this pattern).

If you'd prefer that the decorator not apply to class and static methods,
set the ``instance_methods_only=True`` when decorating the class.

If you want to decorate the class itself, and *not* its methods, keep in
mind that the decorator will be triggered when the class is instantiated,
and that, if the decorator replaces or alters the return, that return will
replace the instantiated class. With those caveats in mind, setting
``implicit_method_decoration=False`` when decorating a class enables that
functionality.

.. note::

    Class decoration, and in particular the decoration of class and static
    methods, is accomplished through some pretty deep, complicated magic.
    The test suite has a lot of tests trying to make sure that everything
    works as expected, but please report any bugs you find so that I
    can resolve them!


Method Decoration
*****************

Decorators can be applied to static, class, or instance methods directly, as
well. If combined with ``@staticmethod`` or ``@classmethod`` decorators,
those decorators should always be at the "top" of the decorator stack
(furthest from the function).

When decorating instance methods, ``self`` is removed from the parameters
passed to the provided callable.

When decorating class methods, ``cls`` is removed from the parameters passed
to the provided callable.

Currently, the class and instance references *do not* have to be named
``"cls"`` and ``"self"``, respectively, in order to be removed. However,
this is not guaranteed for future releases, so try to keep your naming
standard if you can (just FYI, ``"self"`` is the more likely of the two to
wind up being required).

Examples
--------

Below are some examples for the generic and standard decorators. Please
check out the API Docs for more information, and also check out the
convenience decorators, which are all implemented using the
``before``, ``after``, and ``instead`` decorators from this library.

Update a Function's Args or Kwargs
**********************************

Functions passed to ``@before`` can either return None, in which case nothing
happens to the decorated functions parameters, or they can return a tuple
of args (as a tuple) and kwargs (as a dict), in which case those parameters
are used in the decorated function. In this example, we sillify a very
serious function.

.. note::
    Because kwargs are mutable, they can be updated even if the function
    passed to `before` doesn't return anything.

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import before

    def spamify_func(decorated):
        """Mess with the function arguments"""
        args = tuple(['spam' for _ in decorated.args])
        kwargs = {k: 'spam' for k in decorated.kwargs}
        return args, kwargs


    @before(spamify_func)
    def serious_function(serious_string, serious_kwarg='serious'):
        """A very serious function"""
        print('A serious arg: {}'.format(serious_string))
        print('A serious kwarg: {}'.format(serious_kwarg))

    serious_function('Politics', serious_kwarg='Religion')

The output?

.. code::

    A serious arg: spam
    A serious kwarg: spam

Do Something with a Function's Return Value
*******************************************

Functions passed to ``@after`` receive the decorated function's return value
as part of the `Decorated` instance. If ``@after`` returns None, the return
value is sent back unchanged. However, if ``@after`` returns something,
its return value is sent back as the return value of the function.

In this example, we ensure that a function's return value has been thoroughly
spammified.

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import after

    def spamify_return(decorated):
        """Spamify the result of a function"""
        return 'spam-spam-spam-spam-{}-spam-spam-spam-spam'.format(decorated.result)


    @after(spamify_return)
    def unspammed_function():
        """Return a non-spammy value"""
        return 'beef'

    print(unspammed_function())

The output?

.. code::

    spam-spam-spam-spam-beef-spam-spam-spam-spam


Do Something Instead of a Function
**********************************

Functions passed to ``@instead`` also provide wrapped context via the
`Decorated` object. But, if the `instead` callable does not call the
wrapped function, it won't get called at all. Maybe you want to skip
a function when a certain condition is True, but you don't want to use
``pytest.skipif``, because ``pytest`` can't be a dependency of your
production code for whatever reason.


.. code:: python

    from pydecor import instead

    def skip(decorated, when=False):
        if when:
            pass
        else:
            # Calling `decorated` calls the wrapped function.
            return decorated(*decorated.args, **decorated.kwargs)


    @instead(skip, when=True)
    def uncalled_function():
        print("You won't see me (you won't see me)")


    uncalled_function()

The output?

(There is no output, because the function was skipped)


Automatically Log Function Calls and Results
********************************************

Maybe you want to make sure your functions get logged without having to
bother with the logging boilerplate each time. ``@log_call`` tries to
automatically get a logging instance corresponding to the module
in which the decoration occurs (in the same way as if you made a call
to ``logging.getLogger(__name__)``, or you can pass it your own, fancy,
custom, spoiler-bedecked logger instance.

.. code:: python

    from logging import getLogger, StreamHandler
    from sys import stdout

    from pydecor import log_call


    # We're just getting a logger here so we can see the output. This isn't
    # actually necessary for @log_call to work!
    log = getLogger(__name__)
    log.setLevel('DEBUG')
    log.addHandler(StreamHandler(stdout))


    @log_call()
    def get_lucky(*args, **kwargs):
        """We're up all night 'till the sun."""
        return "We're up all night for good fun."


    get_lucky('Too far', 'to give up', who_we='are')


And the output?

.. code::

    get_lucky(*('Too far', 'to give up'), **{'who_we': 'are'}) -> "We're up all night for good fun"


Intercept an Exception and Re-raise a Custom One
************************************************

Are you a put-upon library developer tired of constantly having to re-raise
custom exceptions so that users of your library can have one nice try/except
looking for your base exception? Let's make that easier:

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import intercept


    class BetterException(Exception):
        """Much better than all those other exceptions"""


    @intercept(catch=RuntimeError, reraise=BetterException)
    def sometimes_i_error(val):
        """Sometimes, this function raises an exception"""
        if val > 5:
            raise RuntimeError('This value is too big!')


    for i in range(7):
        sometimes_i_error(i)


The output?

.. code::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Library/Preferences/PyCharm2017.1/scratches/scratch_1.py", line 88, in <module>
        sometimes_i_error(i)
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Documents/Programming/pydecor/pydecor/decorators.py", line 389, in wrapper
        return fn(**fkwargs)
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Documents/Programming/pydecor/pydecor/functions.py", line 58, in intercept
        raise_from(new_exc, context)
      File "<string>", line 2, in raise_from
    __main__.BetterException: This value is too big!


Intercept an Exception, Do Something, and Re-raise the Original
***************************************************************

Maybe you don't *want* to raise a custom exception. Maybe the original
one was just fine. All you want to do is print a special message before
re-raising the original exception. PyDecor has you covered:

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import intercept


    def print_exception(exc):
        """Make sure stdout knows about our exceptions"""
        print('Houston, we have a problem: {}'.format(exc))


    @intercept(catch=Exception, handler=print_exception, reraise=True)
    def assert_false():
        """All I do is assert that False is True"""
        assert False, 'Turns out, False is not True'


    assert_false()

And the output:

.. code::

    Houston, we have a problem: Turns out, False is not True
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Library/Preferences/PyCharm2017.1/scratches/scratch_1.py", line 105, in <module>
        assert_false()
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Documents/Programming/pydecor/pydecor/decorators.py", line 389, in wrapper
        return fn(**fkwargs)
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Documents/Programming/pydecor/pydecor/functions.py", line 49, in intercept
        return decorated(*decorated_args, **decorated_kwargs)
      File "/Users/Nautilus/Library/Preferences/PyCharm2017.1/scratches/scratch_1.py", line 102, in assert_false
        assert False, 'Turns out, False is not True'
    AssertionError: Turns out, False is not True


Intercept an Exception, Handle, and Be Done with It
***************************************************

Sometimes an exception isn't the end of the world, and it doesn't need to
bubble up to the top of your application. In these cases, maybe just handle
it and don't re-raise:

.. code:: python

    from pydecor import intercept


    def let_us_know_it_happened(exc):
        """Just let us know an exception happened (if we are reading stdout)"""
        print('This non-critical exception happened: {}'.format(exc))


    @intercept(catch=ValueError, handler=let_us_know_it_happened)
    def resilient_function(val):
        """I am so resilient!"""
        val = int(val)
        print('If I get here, I have an integer: {}'.format(val))


    resilient_function('50')
    resilient_function('foo')

Output:

.. code::

    If I get here, I have an integer: 50
    This non-critical exception happened: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'foo'

Note that the function does *not* continue running after the exception is
handled. Use this for short-circuiting under certain conditions rather
than for instituting a ``try/except:pass`` block. Maybe one day I'll figure
out how to make this work like that, but as it stands, the decorator surrounds
the entire function, so it does not provide that fine-grained level of control.

More Prête-à-porter Decorators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``skipif`` - similar to py.test's decorator, skip the function if a
  provided condition is True

Let me know if you've got any idea for other decorators that would
be nice to have!


Type Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've dropped support for Python 2, we can use type annotations
to properly annotate function inputs and return values and make them
available to library authors.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or if something doesn't
work the way you think it should, please `raise an issue <issues_>`_.
If you know how to fix the bug, please `open a PR! <prs_>`_

I absolutely welcome any level of contribution. If you think the docs
could be better, or if you've found a typo, please open up a PR to improve
and/or fix them.

Contributor Conduct
*******************

There is a ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`` file with details, based on one of GitHub's
templates, but the upshot is that I expect everyone who contributes to this
project to do their best to be helpful, friendly, and patient. Discrimination
of any kind will not be tolerated and will be promptly reported to GitHub.

On a personal note, Open Source survives because of people who are willing to
contribute their time and effort for free. The least we can do is treat them
with respect.

Tests
*****

Tests can be run with::

   make test

This will use whatever your local `python3` happens to be. If you have
other pythons available, you can run::

   make tox

to try to run locally for all supported Python versions.

If you have docker installed, you can run::

   make test-docker-{version}  # e.g. make test-docker-3.6

to pull down an appropriate Docker image and run tests inside of it. You can
also run::

   make test-docker

to do this for all supported versions of Python.

PRs that cause tests to fail will not be merged until tests pass.

Any new functionality is expected to come with appropriate tests.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via email at
``msplanchard`` ``@`` ``gmail`` or on GH via Issues.

Autoformatting
**************

This project uses black_ for autoformatting. I recommend setting your editor
up to format on save for this project, but you can also run::

   make fmt

to format everything.

Linting
*******

Linting can be run with::

   make lint

Currently, linting verifies that there are:

* No flake8 errors
* No mypy errors
* No pylint errors
* No files that need be formatted

You should ensure that `make lint` returns 0 before opening a PR.

Docs
****

Docs are autogenerated via Sphinx. You can build them locally by running::

   make docs

You can then open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your web browser of
choice to see how the documentation will look with your changes.

Deployment
**********

Deployment is handled through pushing tags. Any tag pushed to GH causes
a push to PyPI if the current version is not yet present there.

Pushing the appropriate tag is made easier through the use of::

   VERSION=1.0.0 make distribute

where `VERSION` obviously should be the current version. This will verify
the specified version matches the package's current version, check to be
sure that the most recent master is being distributed, prompt for a message,
and create and push a signed tag of the format `v{version}`.
